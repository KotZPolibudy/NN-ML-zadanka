# Homework
Your task is to write step-by-step program for generating decision trees without
using any ready packages like scikit. This task will help you to fully understand
all topics from today’s lesson which will be great base for next lesson. The steps
that need to be included are:
• entropy calculation,
• conditional entropy calculation,
• information gain calculation,
• gain ratio calculation,
• simple drawing of a decision tree (there can be really primitive way of
drawing or usage of any ready package to do only this drawing) with the
information how many examples of each class are in each leaf.


Program should be written in Python, preferably with the usage of Jupyter
Notebook. Task is supposed to be done in pairs. The dataset that is provided
in this task is well-known Titanic [5]. The file that is available contains only
part of the data. Column name is just to show that they were real people, you
should omit this column while inducing a decision tree.
There are two possible versions of your homework:
• basic, for 4.0 map column: age to labels in the following way:
– ”young”: [0,20]

– ”middle”: (20,40]

– ”old”: (40,100]

• pro, for 5.0: age is a continuous value
There are two things that are required in this task:
1. Python program described above,
2. short report which includes your names and index numbers, group number, step-by-step results (similarly to the way it was presented during the
lesson) with short comment
